                    A point $z_0$ is said to be an <em id="interior-point">interior point</em>

                    <em id="exterior-point">exterior point</em> of $S$ when
                    there exists a neighborhood of it containing no
                    points of $S.$ If $z_0$ is neither of these, it is a

                    boundary point is, therefore, a point all of whose
                    neighborhoods contain at least one point in $S$ and at
                    least one point not in $S.$ The totality of all boundary points is called the

			Topology is, in essence, the study of the properties that

			gluing.

The "objects" of study in topology are formally defined as topological spaces,
which are sets endowed with a structure, called a topology. 
This topology allows to define continuous deformations of 
subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity.

In particulartopology In the case of the set of complex numbers $\mathbb C$
The "" In topology the main objects of study are called topological spaces.  
We can think of topological spaces as sets of points together with some 
notion of continuity. This notion of continuity, in this case, comes in the form
of a mathematical gadget called topology that determines which funtions mapping out

The technical definition of topology is a bit unintuitive.
