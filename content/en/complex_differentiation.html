                <h1>Complex Differentiation</h1>


                <hr>

                <p>The notion of the complex derivative is the basis of complex function theory.
                    The definition of complex derivative is similar to
                    the derivative of a real function.
                    However, despite a superficial similarity, complex differentiation
                    is a deeply different theory.
                </p>


                <p>A complex function $f(z)$ is <em>differentiable</em> at a point $z_0\in \mathbb C$ if and only
                    if the following limit difference quotient exists
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{diff01}
                    f'(z_0) = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}.
                    \end{eqnarray}
                </div>
                </p>
                <p>Alternatively, letting $\Delta z = z-z_0,$ we can write
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{diff02}
                    f'(z_0) = \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0+\Delta z)-f(z_0)}{\Delta z}.
                    \end{eqnarray}
                </div>
                </p>
                <p>We often drop the subscript on $z_0$ and introduce the number
                    \[\Delta w = f(z+\Delta z)-f(z).\]
                    which denotes the change in the value $w=f(z)$ corresponding to a change $\Delta z$
                    in the point at which $f$ is evaluated. Then we can write equation (\ref{diff02}) as
                    \[\frac{d w}{d z}= \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta w}{\Delta z}.\]
                </p>


                <p>Despite the fact that the formula (\ref{diff01}) for a derivative is identical in form to that of
                    the derivative of a real-valued function, a significant point to note is that $f'(z_0)$
                    follows from a two-dimensional limit. Thus
                    for $f'(z_0)$ to exist, the relevant limit must exist independent of the direction
                    from which $z$ approaches the limit point $z_0.$ For a function of one real variable
                    we only have two directions, that is, $x\lt x_0$ and $x\gt x_0.$

                <p>A remarkable feature of complex differentiation is that the existence of one complex
                    derivative automatically implies the existence of infinitely many!
                    This is in contrast to the case of the function of real variable $g(x),$ in which
                    $g'(x)$ can exist without the existence of $g''(x).$

                <h2>Cauchy-Riemann equations</h2>

                <p>Now let's see a remarkable consequence of definition (\ref{diff01}).
                    First we will see what happens when
                    we approach $z_0$ along the two simplest directions - horizontal and vertical. If
                    we set
                    $$z= z_0 + h = (x_0+h)+iy_0,\quad h\in \mathbb R,$$
                    then $z \rightarrow z_0$ along a horizontal line as $h\rightarrow 0.$
                    If we write $f$ in terms of its real and imaginary components, that is
                    $$f(z) = u(x,y)+iv(x,y),$$
                    then
                    $$f'(z_0)= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}.$$
                    Thus
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    f'(z_0)&amp;= &amp; \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
                    \frac{f(x_0+h + iy_0)-f(x_0+iy_0)}{h} \\
                    &amp;= &amp; \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \left[ \frac{u \left( x_0 +h, y_0 \right) - u \left( x_0 , y_0
                    \right)}{h}\right]+i \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \left[ \frac{v \left( x_0 +h, y_0 \right) - v \left( x_0
                    ,
                    y_0 \right)}{h}\right] \\
                    &amp;= &amp; u_x(x_0, y_0)+ i v_x(x_0,y_0)
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                </div>
                where $u_x(x_0, y_0)$ and $v_x(x_0,y_0)$ denote the first-order partial derivatives with respect
                to $x$ of the function $u$ and $v,$ respectively, at $(x_0, y_0).$
                If now we set
                $$z = z_0+ik = x_0 + i(y_0+k), \quad k\in \mathbb R,$$
                then $z\rightarrow 0$ along a vertical line as $k\rightarrow 0.$ Therefore, we also have
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    f'(z_0)&amp;= &amp; \lim_{k \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0+ik)-f(z_0)}{ik} = \lim_{k \rightarrow 0}
                    \left[
                    -i \frac{f(x_0 + i(y_0+k))-f(x_0+iy_0)}{k} \right] \\
                    &amp;= &amp; \lim_{k \rightarrow 0} \left[ \frac{v \left( x_0 , y_0 + k\right) - v \left( x_0 , y_0
                    \right)}{k}-i \frac{u \left( x_0 , y_0 +k \right) - u \left( x_0 , y_0 \right)}{k}\right] \\
                    &amp;= &amp; v_y(x_0, y_0)- i u_y(x_0,y_0)
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                </div>

                where the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ are, this time, with respect to $y.$
                By equating the real and imaginary parts of these two formulae for the complex derivative
                $f'(z_0),$ we notice that the real and imaginary components of $f(z)$ must satisfy a
                homogeneous linear system of partial differential equations:
                $$u_x=v_y, \quad u_y=-v_x.$$
                These are the <em>Cauchy-Riemann equations</em> named after the famous nineteenth
                century mathematicians Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Bernhard Riemann, two of the
                founders of modern complex analysis.
                </p>


                <div class="theorem">
                    A complex function $f(z)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$
                    has a complex derivative $f'(z)$ if and only if its real and imaginary part are
                    continuously differentiable and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    u_x=v_y, \quad u_y=-v_x
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    In this case, the complex derivative of $f(z)$ is equal to any of the following
                    expressions:
                    $$f'(z)=u_x+iv_x = v_y - i u_y.$$

                </div>



                <div class="practice">
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Consider the function $f(z)=z^2,$ which can be written as
                        $$z^2 = \left(x^2-y^2\right)+ i \left(2xy\right).$$
                        Its real part $u = x^2-y^2$ and imaginary part $v=2xy$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
                        since
                        $$u_x=2x = v_y, \quad u_y = -2y = -v_x.$$
                        Theorem 1 implies that $f(z)=z^2$ is differentiable. Its derivative turns out to be
                    <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                        $$f'(z)=u_x+iv_x = v_y - i u_y = 2x + i 2y = 2(x+iy) = 2z.$$

                <p>Fortunately, the complex derivative has all of the usual rules that we have learned in
                    real-variable calculus. For example,
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$\frac{d}{dz}z^n = nz^{n-1}, \quad \frac{d}{dz} e^{cz} = ce^{cz}, \quad \frac{d}{dz} \log z =
                    \frac{1}{z},$$
                </div>
                </p>
                <p>and so on. In this case, the power $n$ can be a real number (or even complex in view of the identity
                    $z^n = e^{n \log z}$), while $c$ is any complex constant. The <a

                    for the complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions implies that they also satisfy the standard
                    rules
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray*}

                </p>
                <p>
                    If the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ exist at a point $z,$ then
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    \frac{d}{dz}\left[f(z)+g(z) \right]=f^{\prime}(z)+g^{\prime}(z)\\
                    \frac{d}{dz}\left[f(z)g(z) \right]=f(z)g^{\prime}(z)+f^{\prime}(z)g(z)
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    and, when $g(z)\neq 0,$
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    \frac{d}{dz}\left[\frac{f(z)}{g(z)}
                    \right]=\frac{g(z)f^{\prime}(z)-f(z)g^{\prime}(z)}{\left[g(z)\right]^2}
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    Finally, suppose that
                    $f$ has a derivative at $z_0$ and that $g$ has a derivative at the point $f (z_0).$ Then the
                    function $F(z) = g\left(f (z)\right)$ has a derivative at $z_0,$ and
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    F^{\prime}(z)=g^{\prime}\left(f(z_0)\right)f^{\prime}(z_0)
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    Note that the formulae for differentiating sums, products, ratios, inverses, and
                    compositions of complex functions are all identical to their
                    real counterparts, with similar proofs.
                    This means that you don't need to learn any new rules for
                    performing complex differentiation!

                    Satisfaction of the Cauchy-Riemann equations at a point $z_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ is not sufficient

                    However, by adding continuity conditions to the partial derivatives,
                    we have the following useful theorem.

                    $u(x,y)=c_1$ for a real constant $c_1,$ are orthogonal to the level curves of $v,$ where
                    $v(x,y)=c_2,$ at
                    all points where $f^{\prime}$ exists and is nonzero. From <strong>Theorem 2</strong> we have

                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    \bigg|f^{\prime}(z)\bigg|^2 &= &\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial
                    v}{\partial x}\right)^2\\
                    &=& \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^2\\
                    &=& \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)^2
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                </div>

                hence the two-dimensional gradients

                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{align*}
                    \nabla u &= \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) \quad
                    \text{and}\quad
                    \nabla v = \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x},\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)
                    \end{align*}
                </div>

                are nonzero. We know from vector calculus that the gradient is orthogonal to its level curve (i. e.,
                $du=\nabla u\cdot \mathbf{ds}=0,$ where $\mathbf{ds}$ point in the direction of the tangent to the
                level
                curve), and from the Cauchy-Riemann condition (<strong>Theorem 2</strong>) we see that the
                gradients $\nabla u$ and $\nabla v$ are orthogonal because their vector dot product vanishes:
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    \nabla u\cdot \nabla v&=& \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial
                    u}{\partial y}\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\\
                    &=&-\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial
                    x}\frac{\partial
                    u}{\partial x}=0
                    \end{eqnarray*}

                    Consequently, the two-dimensional level curves $u(x,y)=c_1$ and $v(x,y)=c_2$ are orthogonal.

                <h2>Analytic functions</h2>

                <p>Let $f:A\rightarrow \mathbb C$ where $A\subset \mathbb C$ is an open set. The function is
                    said to be <em>analytic</em> on $A$ if $f$ is differentiable at each $z_0\in A.$ The
                    word "holomorphic", which is sometimes used, is synonymous with the word "analytic". The phrase
                    <em>"analytic at $z_0$"</em> means $f$ is analytic on a neighborhood of $z_0.$
                </p>

                <p>
                    An <strong>entire function</strong> is a function that is analytic at each point in the
                    entire finite
                    plane.
                    Since the derivative of a polynomial exists everywhere,
                    it follows that <strong>every polynomial is an entire function</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a function $f$ fails to be analytic at a point $z_0$ but is analytic at some point
                    in every neighbourhood of $z_0,$ then $z_0$ is called a
                    <strong>singular point</strong> or
                    <strong>singularity</strong>, of $f.$

                        <strong>Example 4:</strong>
                        The function $$f(z) = \frac{1}{z}$$ is analytic at each nonzero point in the finite
                        plane. On the other hand, the function $$f(z) = |z|^2$$
                        is not analytic at any point since its derivative
                        exists only at $z = 0$ and not throughout any neighbourhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The point $z = 0$ is evidently a singular point of the function $f(z) = 1/z.$ The
                        function $f(z) = |z|^2,$ on the other hand, has no singular points since it is nowhere
                        analytic.

                </div>

                <p>
                    If two functions are analytic in
                    a domain $D,$ their sum and their product are both analytic in $D.$
                    Similarly, their quotient is analytic in $D$ provided the
                    function in the denominator does not vanish at
                    any point in $D.$ In particular, the quotient
                    $$\frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$$ of two polynomials is analytic
                    in any domain throughout which $Q(z)\neq 0.$
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, from the chain rule for the derivative
                    of a composite function, it implies that
                    a composition of two analytic functions is analytic.

                        is analytic throughout the $z$ plane except for the singular points $z=0$ and $z=1,-1.$
                        The analyticity
                        is due to the existence of familiar differentiation
                        formulas, which need to be applied only if the expression for $f^{\prime}(z)$ is
                        wanted. In this case, we have
                        $$f^{\prime}(z)=\frac{-8z^3-3z^2+1}{z^2(z^2-1)^2}.$$

                    v(x, y),$$ its analyticity can be demonstrated by direct application of the Cauchy-Riemann

                    Another useful property what we will use later is the following:

                <div class="theorem" id="derivative-zero">
                    If $f'(z)=0$ everywhere in a domain $D,$
                    then $f(z)$ is constant throughout $D.$
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    Let $z_1,z_2\in D.$ Let $c(t):[a,b]\to \C$ be a path joining 
                    $z_1$ to $z_2.$ That is, $c(a)=z_1$ and $c(b)=z_2.$  
                    Using the chain rule we have 
                    \[
                    \frac{d}{dt}f\left(c(t)\right) = f'\left(c(t)\right)\cdot c'(t) = 0,

                    since $f'(z)=0$ everywhere in $D.$

                    From calculus, this implies that $u\left(c(t)\right)$ 
                    and $v\left(c(t)\right)$ are constant functions of $t.$ 
                    By comparing the values at $t=a$ and $t=b$ we conclude that 
                    $f(z_1) = f(z_2).$ Therefore, $f$ is constant throughout $D.$
