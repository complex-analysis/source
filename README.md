# Translations

I made the versions in [English](https://complex-analysis.com) and [Spanish](https://complex-analysis.com/es.html). 
Currentyl [Ruan Passos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruan-passos-8177331a5/) is working on a portugues version.

If you are interested in making a translation to another language,
let me know. Send me a message at <a href="mailto:jcponcemath@gmail.com">jcponcemath@gmail.com</a> 
to get instructions on how to make a translation. ∞ Thanks!
