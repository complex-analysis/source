            <h1>Laurent Series</h1>

            <hr>

            <p>
                Recall that a function $f$ of the complex variable $z$ is <em>analytic</em> at
                a point $z_0$ if it has a derivative at each point in some neighborhood of $z_0.$
                An <em>entire</em> function is a function that is analytic at each point in the
                entire finite plane.
                If a function $f$ fails to be analytic at a point $z_0$ but is analytic at some point
                in every neighborhood of $z_0,$ then $z_0$ is called a
                <em>singular point</em>, or <em>singularity</em>, of $f.$

            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose that $f(z),$ or any single valued branch
                of $f(z),$ if $f(z)$ is multivalued, is analytic in the
                region
                $0\lt|z-z_0|\lt R$
                and not at the point $z_0.$ Then the point $z_0$ is
                called an <em>isolated singular point</em> of $f(z).$

            </p>

            <p>
                Now, recall also that any function which is analytic throughout a disk
                $|z -z_0|\lt R_0$ must have a Taylor series about $z_0.$ If the function
                fails to be analytic at a point $z_0,$ it is often possible to find a series
                representation for $f(z)$ involving both positive and negative powers of $z - z_0.$
                Formally speaking we have the following result:

                Suppose that a function $f$ is analytic throughout an annular domain
                $R_1 \lt |z - z_0| \lt R_2,$ centered at $z_0,$ and let $C$ denote any positively oriented simple
                closed contour around $z_0$ and lying in that domain. Then, at each point in
                the domain, $f (z)$ has the series representation
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{laurentfunction}
                f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(z-z_0)^n+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_n}{(z-z_0)^n},

                    $f(z)$ is analytic throughout an annular domain

                As a very simple example of (\ref{laurentfunction}) let us consider
                the function
                \[
                f(z) = \frac{1}{z-1}.
                \]
                As you can seen, the point $z = 1$ is an isolated singularity of
                $f$ and consequently the function cannot be expanded in a Taylor
                series centered at that point. Nevertheless, $f$ can expanded
                in a series of the form given in (\ref{laurentfunction})
                that is valid for all $z$ near $1:$
            </p>
            <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{simple-example}
                f(z) = \cdots + 0 \cdot (z-1)^2 + 0 \cdot (z-1) + 0 +  \frac{1}{(z-1)} + \frac{0}{(z-1)^2} + \cdots
                \end{eqnarray}
            </div>
            <p>
                This series representation is valid for $0 \lt |z - 1| \lt \infty.$

                The series on the right-hand side of (\ref{laurentfunction})
                are given special names. The part consisting of the nonnegative powers
                of $z - z_0$,
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{analytic-part}
                \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(z-z_0)^n
                \end{eqnarray}
                is called the <span id="analytic-part"><strong>analytic part</strong></span>
                of the series (\ref{laurentfunction}) and will converge for 
                $|z - z_0| \lt R_2.$
                The part with negative powers of $z - z_0,$ that is,
                \begin{eqnarray}\label{principal-part}
                \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{b_n}{(z-z_0)^n}
                \end{eqnarray}
                is called the <span id="principal-part"><strong>principal part</strong></span> of the series (\ref{laurentfunction})
                and will converge for
               
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$\abs{\frac{1}{z-z_0}}\lt \frac{1}{R_1} \quad
                \text{or equivalent }\quad
                 R_1 \lt \abs{z-z_0}.$$
                </div>

            <p>
                Hence, the sum of (\ref{analytic-part}) and (\ref{principal-part}) 
                converges when $z$ satisfies both $R_1 \lt \abs{z-z_0}$ <em>and</em>
                $\abs{z-z_0}\lt R_2$, that is, when $z$ is
                a point in an annular domain defined by $R_1 \lt |z - z_0| \lt R_2.$

            <p>
                The principal part of the series (\ref{simple-example}) 
                consists of exactly one nonzero 
                term, whereas its analytic part consists of all zero terms.
                The following example illustrates a series of the form (\ref{laurentfunction}) 
                in which the principal part of the series also consists 
                of a finite number of nonzero terms, but this time the 
                analytic part consists of an infinite number of nonzero terms.

                    <strong>Example 1: </strong>
                    The function $f(z) = \dfrac{\sin z}{z^4}$ 
                    is not analytic at the isolated singularity $z = 0 $
                    and hence cannot be expanded in a Maclaurin series.
                    However, $\sin z$ is an entire
                    function, and we know that its Maclaurin series,

                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    $$\sin z = z - \frac{z^3}{3!}+ \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \frac{z^9}{9!}- \cdots,$$
                </div>
                <p>
                    converges for $|z|\lt \infty.$ By dividing this power
                    series by $z^4$ we obtain a series
                    for $f$ with negative and positive integer powers of $z:$
                </p>
                <div class="scroll-wrapper">
                    \begin{eqnarray}\label{example-1}
                    f(z) = \dfrac{\sin z}{z^4} = \overbrace{\frac{1}{z^3} - \frac{1}{3!z} }^{\large \textbf{Principal part}} \underbrace{+ \frac{z}{5!} - \frac{z^3}{7!} + \frac{z^5}{9!}- \cdots}_{\large \textbf{Analytic part}}
                    \end{eqnarray}

                <p>
                    The analytic part of the series in (\ref{example-1}) 
                    converges for $|z|\lt \infty.$ (Verify!)
                    The principal part is valid for $|z|>0.$ Thus (\ref{example-1}) 
                    converges for all $z$ except at $z=0;$ 
                    that is, the series representation is valid for $0 \lt |z| \lt \infty.$

            <p>
                In practice, the above integral formulae (\ref{non-principalpart}) and
                (\ref{principalpart}) provided in <strong>Theorem 1</strong> may not offer the most practical
                method for computing the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ for a given function
                $f(z)$; instead, one often pieces together the Laurent series by combining
                known Taylor expansions, as we did in <strong>Example 1</strong>. 
                Because the <strong>Laurent expansion of a function is
                unique whenever it exists</strong>, any expression of this form that actually
                equals the given function $f(z)$ in some annulus must actually be the
                Laurent expansion of $f(z).$
            </p>

            <div class="practice">
                <p><strong>Example 2: </strong>
                    Consider the function
                    $$f(z)=\frac{1}{z(1+z^2)}$$
                    which has isolated singularities at $z=0$
                    and $z=\pm i.$
                    In this case, there is a Laurent series representation for the
                    domain $0\lt |z|\lt 1$ and also one for the domain $1\lt |z|\lt \infty,$
                    which is exterior to the circle $|z|=1.$
                    To find each of these Laurent series, we recall the Maclaurin series representation
                    $$\frac{1}{1-z}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}z^n,\quad |z|\lt 1.$$
                    For the domain $0\lt |z|\lt 1,$ we have
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    f(z)&=&\frac{1}{z}\frac{1}{1+z^2}=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(-z^2\right)^n \\
                    &=&\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^nz^{2n-1}\\
                    &=&\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^nz^{2n-1} \\
                    &=& \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n+1}z^{2n+1}+\frac{1}{z}.
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    On the other hand, when $1\lt |z|\lt \infty,$
                    \begin{eqnarray*}
                    f(z)&=&\frac{1}{z^3}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{z^2}}=\frac{1}{z^3}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(-\frac{1}{z^2}
                    \right)^n\\
                    & =&\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{z^{2n+3}}\\
                    &=&\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{z^{2n+1}}
                    \end{eqnarray*}
                    In this last part we use the fact that $(-1)^{n-1}=(-1)^{n-1}(-1)^2=(-1)^{n+1}.$
